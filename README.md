My first own Swift app

May 2, 2024 - My First git repo for my First Swift app

Today was like a dream! It marked the first of many exciting steps I'll be taking in the days to come. I hit a big milestone - I uploaded the code for my very first finished Swift app to Git. This isn't just any old app, it's a handy check splitter application. Half of it was born from following a detailed tutorial, while the other half sprang entirely from my imagination. It may be a simple app, but it's powered by SwiftUI, which really makes it hum. This is just the starting line for me. I'm eager to expand my skills and knowledge to start crafting full-scale Mac and iOS apps.

The guiding star of my career path is the idea of being "At the intersection of People, Design, and Technology." I believe this magical sweet spot can be reached by harnessing the power of Swift. Over the next six months, I'm planning to dive headfirst into this realm, eager to uncover all its secrets. My main mission is to create innovative and useful apps in Swift, and once I've achieved that, I'm itching to explore the server-side capabilities that Swift generously provides.

Of course, I've got my sights set on mastering JavaScript too because of its vital role in client-side operations. If my goal is to create rich, interactive UI applications, then getting a solid grip on JavaScript is a must.

Juggling the learning of Design and Technology will certainly be a fun challenge, but I believe it's a risk worth taking. This is mostly because I love what I'm doing and it fits perfectly with my career vision.

I'm optimistic that all this hard work and learning will lead me to create a scalable product or service-based business someday. Even though the future can be a little foggy, I see it as a golden opportunity that I'm determined to grab with both hands and make the most of.
